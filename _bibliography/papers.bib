Given their structure, the number of parameters they incorporate and the collective communication librairies they are built with, LLM training and inference (or serving) network traffic has specific characteristics.},

  abstract={This document presents a distributed mechanism to enforce strict delay bounds for some network flows in large scale networks.  It leverages on the capacity of modern network devices to adapt their queue's capacities to bound the maximum time spent by packets in those devices.  It is using a reservation protocol to guarantee the availability of the resources in the devices' queues to serve packets belonging to specific flows while enforcing an end-to-end delay constraint.},

  type={publication},
  abstract={Various technologies, including SRv6, allow to perform Traffic Engineering (TE), steering IP traffic through a specific path. However, there is no native mechanism in IP that allows to verify whether or not a packet did follow the path it was supposed to.  This document specifies a new TLV for the Segment Routing Header (SRH) that allows to provide a cryptographically generated proof of transit over the different segments.  The proposed mechanisms allows to verify whether a packet did go through the segments listed in its SRH header in the intended order.},
