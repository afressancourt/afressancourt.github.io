I am a principal research engineer in Huawei's European research center in Paris, where I am part of [the IP protocols team](https://ip-protocols.github.io). 

My current research focuses on improving networks' operations in the distributed execution of AI/LLM workloads. 

Along the years, my goal has constantly been to improve the way data networks deal with future networking use cases, especially to support the increasingly demanding quality of service requirements of real-time applications (AI, video, gaming...) and to enhance networks' intrinsic security, privacy and resiliency properties. 

I am actively involved in the IETF, where I serve as a member and reviewer of the Internet area directorate.

Prior to this, I was a R&D engineer in Worldline and a member of Atos's Scientific Community where I was leading the networking research track. I hold a PhD from Télécom Paristech where I studied the resiliency of inter-data center network connectivity. I also graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris (ECP) and from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (KTH).
